Alignment Summary
=================
    Raw reads were mapped or aligned to the reference organism using `STAR software`_.

    .. _STAR software: https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR


    The **uniquely mapped read counts** and the **total read counts** for all the samples are summarized in the following image. In most cases, more than 70% of the reads should uniquely map to the reference genome.
    Contamination, low quality sequencing data, or poor library contruction may result in <60% uniquely aligned reads.

Library Prep Quality Metrics
=============================
Read Distribution QC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    This graph displays the disibution of reads mapped to **features** across the genome for each sample. Distribution profiles should be similar across samples.
    A sample with a siginficantly different distribution profile may indicate that it was initially a poor sample or that there was a problem during library preparation.
    **mRNAseq libraries will typically contain less than 20% intronic mapped reads** whereas **totalRNAseq libraries may have greater than 40% intronic mapped reads**.

    .. image:: $read_distrib

rRNA removal QC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    This graph displays the percentage of reads mapping to ribosomal RNA reference sequences. Most RNAseq library prep methods are designed to avoid sampling ribosomal RNAs which typically represent greater than 80% of total RNA. If rRNA removal was effective, less than 5% of the reads should map to rRNA sequences and for mRNA libraries fewer than 1%.

    .. image:: $rRNA_report


Genebody Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    For accurate gene expression quantification, mapped reads should be evenly distributed across genebodies.
    Significantly skewed profiles (5' or 3') may introduce quantification bias and/or represent poor quality library preparation.\n
    For example, mRNAseq library preps typically use oligo-dT beads to capture mature transcripts and can be prone to 3' bias in genebody coverage if degraded RNA \(RIN < 7\) is used as input. This may result in inaccurate gene quantification and the following graphs will help diagnose.
    There are other prep methods that may result in 5' bias too. Ideally, coverage should be uniform across the genebody. The line plots should look like this: "âˆ©"

Experimental Quality Control
===============================

Principle Component Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    High dimensional expression data are mathmatically reduced to principle
    components that can be used to describe variation across samples in fewer dimensions to allow human interpretation.
    Principle component 1 \(PC1\) accounts for the most amount of variation across samples, PC2 the second most, and so on. These PC1 vs PC2 plots
    are colored by sample annotation to demontrate how samples cluster together \(or not\) in reduced dimensional space.
    For more detailed description of Princilple Component Analysis, start with `wikipedia`_.

Volcano Plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Volcano plots are commonly used graphical representations of differentially expressed genes and statistical significance.
    These scatter plots show log2 fold change versus P-value for all genes detected. Each data point represents a gene. Genes are colored red if the log2 fold change is greater than one \(log2fc > 1\). Genes are colored blue if the log2 fold change is less than negative one \(log2fc < -1\).
    The plot title indicates the direction of the comparison.
    For example, "treatment_vs_control" indicates that genes colored red are up-regulated in the treatment condition compared to the control condition with a statistically significant P-value.
